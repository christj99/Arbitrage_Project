# Arbitrage_Project

The aim of this project is to create a dashboard with all possible arbitrage bets between any two combination of bookeepers, odds provided by an API.
As of right now the code uploaded will calculate all arbitrage opportunities for all sports being tracked and place them in a google sheet.
Future updates include creating an api of my own to post the best bets to and store, tracking book makers of my own and trends.
automation, scheduling, and power BI are additional next steps.
